        <li>Tuck the wing tips back.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, set Traeger to 350℉ and preheat, lid closed for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the can of beer and set the chicken on top of the beer. Make sure all but the bottom 1-1/2 inch of the beer can is in the cavity of the chicken. Tip: you can also place the beer can directly on the grill grates, then place the chicken on top.</li>
        <li>Place the entire chicken and beer can directly on the grill grate. Cook for 60 to 75 minutes, or until the internal temperature registers 165℉ in the thickest part of the breast.</li>
